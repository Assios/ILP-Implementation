# ILP implementation

An implementation of intuitionistic logic programming in Python, based on this paper (Nprolog-link).
## Usage
```sh
$ python nprolog.py file.npro
```
**Then just run queries!**
## Prolog syntax

This implementation uses a regular Prolog syntax, with some changes to support intuitionistic logic programming. You add facts and rules to an .npro-file, and then you can run queries on it after loading the file.
